# Marginal Distributions for IRT Parameters
# ============================================================================
# Each parameter has its own marginal distribution.

irt_parameters:
  # Difficulty (b): How hard the question is on the IRT scale
  # Typical range: -3 to +3, where higher = harder
  difficulty:
    distribution: normal
    params:
      mean: 0.0
      std: 1.0
      
  # Discrimination (a): How well the question separates high/low ability candidates
  # Typical range: 0.5 to 2.5, must be positive
  discrimination:
    distribution: truncated_normal
    params:
      mean: 1.0
      std: 0.3
      lower: 0.3  # Minimum 0.3 to prevent degenerate items
      upper: null

  # Guessing (c): Lower asymptote - probability of correct for very low ability
  # For 4-choice items, typically around 0.20-0.25
  guessing:
    distribution: truncated_normal

  # Distractor quality: How attractive wrong answers are to low-ability candidates
  # Higher = more attractive distractors (well-designed questions)
  # Sampled independently per distractor (not included in joint distribution)

    distribution: truncated_normal

# ============================================================================
# Parameter Correlations
# ============================================================================
# Pairwise correlations between difficulty, discrimination, and guessing.
# These capture realistic relationships in item parameters.
#
# The correlation matrix must be positive semi-definite (PSD).
# Values must be in [-1, 1] and satisfy mathematical constraints.
#
# Distractor quality is NOT included - it's sampled independently per distractor.
#
# Common patterns in real exams:
#   - difficulty_discrimination < 0: Harder items often discriminate less well
#   - difficulty_guessing > 0: Harder items may have more guessing
#   - discrimination_guessing < 0: High discrimination items have less guessing

correlations:
  difficulty_discrimination: 0.0   # Range: [-1, 1]
  difficulty_guessing: 0.0         # Range: [-1, 1]
  discrimination_guessing: 0.0     # Range: [-1, 1]
